1.0 Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass system was developed for a company whose business model focused on improving DMV driving test scores. The business owner, Liam, wanted a system that could be used offline and online on mobile devices and desktop PCs. The system requirements were to allow students to register and purchase training packages, take practice tests and classes online, and schedule driving lessons. Due to the system's complexity, different user roles were included, such as Administrators, Instructors, and Secretaries. Each of these roles served different functions and supported the system differently. The project's primary goal was to design a web-based system that effectively improved driver training and test scores.

2.0 What did you do particularly well?

  I identified the user roles that best matched the client's specific needs. I made sure the system supported these needs by incorporating lesson scheduling, account management, and keeping up to date with the DMV. 

3.0 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 

  If I could revise part of my work, I would revisit my class and sequence diagrams. I tried to be thorough, but some areas may have been too detailed, especially for those unfamiliar with UML. Recreating the diagrams and keeping things simple might make them easier for everyone to understand.

3.1 How would you improve it?

4.0 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 

Interpreting the user's needs and implementing them into system design requires listening carefully to the client. Communication between the client and breaking down the user's needs into smaller components was key to success. 

4.1 Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Ultimately, it is the user who interacts with the system. A good design would ensure the system meets user expectations and remains easy to use. Testing is difficult for many people. If the project's goal was to improve test scores and the user interface was challenging to navigate, the business would suffer. 

5.0 How do you approach designing software? 

First, I would start with the people who would be using it. For example, understanding their goals and what challenges they may have helps create a system that is user-friendly and encourages user and business success. Next, I would 
break down the system into functional and non-functional requirements. Using case and class diagrams, we can organize ideas and communicate these ideas to all team members. 

5.1 What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Some techniques would be interviewing the user and gathering information on individual needs. This ensures the system supports the end user's necessary requirements. The system would be created in small chunks and presented to the end user iteratively. This way, if any changes may need to be made, they can be caught early, ensuring that the system meets the user's expectations without making assumptions.
